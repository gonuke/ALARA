## Sample 5: Expert
## Highlights: 2-D torodial geometry, reverse mode (target),
## complex pulsing scheme w/ sub-schedules and multiple fluxes
##
## NOTE: you should run sample1 before any other samples to ensure
## that the data is available
##
## NOTE: you should run sample6 before this sample to ensure reverse
## mode data is available.

geometry torus

## The two parameters of dimension (r and theta) are appropriate
## for the defined geometry (torus)

dimension 	r
		  0.0
	1	  5.0
end

dimension	theta
		   0.0
	1	   3.14159
end

## Since we are using a torroidal geometry, we must also define 
## the major radius and, if no radial dimension is defined, 
## must also define a minor radius if we desire

## The "target" command invokes the "reverse mode" in ALARA, 
## where the output will track the desired element (he in this case)

## The pulsing scheme will employ sub-schedules and several fluxes
flux flux_1   data/fluxin1	1.0 	0	default

flux flux_2   data/fluxin2	1.0 	0	default

flux flux_3   data/fluxin3	1.0 	0	default

# this is a simple schedule consisting of one pulse of duration 5 s
# repeated twice (double_pulse) with 10 s between each pulse (double_pulse)

end

# this is a complex schedule consisting of:
#   one pulse of duration 10 s at flux specturm/level flux_1 followed by a 12 s delay
#   one pulse of duration 10 s at flux specturm/level flux_2 followed by a 3 s delay
#   one pulse of duration 10 s at flux specturm/level flux_3 followed by a 5 s delay
#   three repetitions (triple_pulse) of the simple schedule sub_1,
#                 with 100 s between each repetition (triple_pulse)
