/** \brief This class is invoked as a linked list and describes the 
 *         various mixtures used in the problem.  
 *   
 *  Each object is a named mixture which may be referenced as part of 
 *  zero, one or more loadings.  The first element in each list is named
 *  IN_HEAD (defined in Input.h), and contains no problem data.
 *  NOTE: The term constituent has been introduced in the user manual
 *  and user interaction to refer to the 'Components' of a 'Mixture'.
 *  By necessity, the vocabulary of the source code has not been
 *  changed, and class and variable names will refer to components.
